# pac_probability

pac_probability is a packaged developed to calculate and plot gaussian, binomial and general probabilitiy distribution. It is published on python package index(PyPi). 

## Setup

To run
```
pip install pac-probability
```
pac_probability package will be installed on the system with default version using pip.

Then type,
```
from pac_probability import Gaussian, Binomial

Gaussian(12,8)
```
The output mean is 12 and standard deviation is 8.

Also
```
Binomial(0.8, 21)
```
The output mean is 16.8, standard deviation is 1.8330302779823358, p is 0.8 and n is 21.
